## Objective:

The primary goal of this dashboard is to analyze user behaviour, digital habits and consumption, and its impact on productivity, lifestyle, and reading behaviours across various demographics. The analysis is structured to achieve the following key questions:
[Social Media Questions](https://github.com/JoyIbe/Zefas-and-Data-Crunch-Challenge-Using-Figma-and-Power-BI/blob/4f35b3f9b5c4c9701ef55f35977ebedcb9cceea3/Social%20Media%20Questions.docx)

Data Structure: The dataset contained 40 Columns and 300,000 rows of data.

## Tools and Methodology:

### Tools: 

Figma: UI/UX design

Power Query: I used power query to restructure and shape data (segmenting 40 columns into different tables) for modeling to optimize performance speed.

Dax: I used Dax functionalities to develop new tables and generate measures for key metrics and custom visuals.

Power BI: To build the interactive dashboard.

### Method:

Data Cleaning: This data provided for this challenge was in a clean state.
 
Data Processing: With Power Bi's Dax functionalities, I created calculated measures to show valuable metrics, customized and design visuals to aid clarity in understanding trends.

Data Modeling: Modeling this data allows for multiple tables with lesser column information to speed up processing time, reduce redundancy and increase efficiency.

Data Visualization: Built a two page interactive dashboards  to understand user behavior, optimize content strategies, and develop healthier digital consumption patterns, balancing the use of social media, entertainment, technology, cultivating more physical habits and prioritizing audience's well-being.
